# Dotfiles

This repo stores and manages the install of various dotfiles and settings files.

## First time set up

On a new environment initial set up is handled by the standalone file
[`init.sh`](init.sh)
which can be retrieved directly from the master branch.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vibronicshark55/dotfiles/master/init.sh
sh init.sh
```

First time running the script will create SSH keys for use with repo hosting
services. After the keys are created further running the script will clone this
repo, if it does not already exist.

## Add dotfiles

The addition of dotfiles and other settings is handled by [`install.sh`](install.sh)
which is available upon cloning this repo. This script must then be passed then
name of the settings to install, or all. it is recommended that users use the
`-a` or `--archive` flag on initial install to ensure previous dotfiles are
preserved.

```
sh install.sh -a all
```

- [repos](#repos)^
